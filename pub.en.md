# Distribution Patterns of Prime Numbers and Their Implications on the Infinitude of Twin Primes  

**Author**: Yunxiang Gong  

**Abstract**:  
This paper analyzes the characteristics of sieve methods in the generation of prime numbers and proposes a modular structure-based model for prime distribution. By constructing residue number sets after sieving with primes such as 2, 3, and 5, we reveal the periodic distribution features of "pseudo-prime numbers" and demonstrate the transitivity of these characteristics in subsequent sieving processes. Furthermore, using proof by contradiction, we explore the potential infinitude of twin primes. The analysis suggests that the non-eliminable transitivity of these properties provides theoretical support for the infinite existence of twin primes.

## 1. Introduction  

The Twin Prime Conjecture—whether there exist infinitely many prime pairs of the form $(p, p+2)—remains$ a central unsolved problem in number theory. Although Yitang Zhang [@zhang2014bounded, @maynard2015small, @castryck2014new] proved the existence of infinitely many prime pairs with gaps less than 70 million using bounded gap methods, reducing the gap to exactly 2 requires groundbreaking theoretical tools. This paper extends the perspective of the Sieve of Eratosthenes to propose a modular structure-based prime distribution model and investigates the infinitude of twin primes through the lens of property transitivity.  

## 2. Definitions and Notations  

**Definition 2.1 (Pseudo-Primes)**: For a given sequence of primes $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$ , natural numbers not eliminated by this sequence are termed **pseudo-primes**, and their set is denoted as $\mathcal{S}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k)$ .  
**Definition 2.2 (Pseudo-Twin Primes)**: If adjacent elements $(q, q+2)$ exist in the pseudo-prime set, they are called **pseudo-twin primes**.  
**Remark**: Pseudo-primes may be genuine primes or unsieved composites, but their distribution follows the periodic patterns of sieve methods.  

## 3. Property Transitivity in Prime Sieving  

### 3.1 Initial Sieving Stages  

- **Prime 2**: After sieving all even numbers, the remaining pseudo-primes form the odd number set $\{2m+1 \mid m \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ (see Appendix Figure 1).  
- **Prime 3**: Further sieving multiples of 3 yields pseudo-primes as $\{6m \pm 1 \mid m \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ (see Appendix Figure 2). At this stage, the probability of pseudo-twin primes with a gap of 2 is $\frac{1}{6}$.  

### 3.2 Advanced Sieving Stages  

After introducing a prime $p_k$, the **pseudo-prime** set can be expressed as:  

$$
\mathcal{S}(2,3,\ldots,p_k) = \bigcup_{i} \begin{Bmatrix} \left( \prod_{j=1}^k p_j \cdot m \pm a_i \right) \mid m \in \mathbb{Z} \end{Bmatrix},
$$  

where $a_i$ represents offsets coprime to $\prod_{j=1}^k p_j$. For example, after introducing 5, the pseudo-prime set becomes $\{30m \pm 1, \pm 7, \pm 11, \pm 13\}$ (see Appendix Figure 3).  

The cyclic period of the pseudo-prime set after $p_k$ is $\prod_{j=1}^{k} p_j$, where $p_1, \ldots, p_j$ are consecutive primes from 2 to the $k$-th prime. Each new prime introduces pseudo-prime candidates within a new cycle.  

**Theorem 3.1 (Invariance of Pseudo-Prime Property Transitivity)**: For any prime sequence $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k$, the distribution properties of pseudo-primes generated by the sieve satisfy the following when introducing a new prime $p_{k+1}$:  

- **Retention of ±1 Candidate Pairs**: Pseudo-twin prime pairs of the form $\prod_{j=1}^k p_j \cdot m \pm 1$ are retained unless $m \equiv \pm 1 \pmod{p_{k+1}}$ (exact values depend on modular arithmetic);  
- **Proportion of Retained Candidates**: A fraction $\frac{p_{k+1}-2}{p_{k+1}}$ of incremental pseudo-twin prime pairs remain unaffected by the new prime;  
- **Incremental Quantity per Cycle**: Within the cycle $\prod_{j=1}^{k+1} p_j$, $p_{k+1}-2$ incremental pseudo-twin prime pairs are retained.  

**Proof**: Consider pseudo-twin prime pairs $\prod_{j=1}^k p_j \cdot m \pm 1$. Since $p_{k+1}$ is coprime to $\prod_{j=1}^k p_j$, by modular arithmetic:  

$$
\prod_{j=1}^k p_j \cdot m \pm 1 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{p_{k+1}} \quad \text{unless} \quad m \equiv \pm \left( \prod_{j=1}^k p_j \right)^{-1} \pmod{p_{k+1}}.  
$$  

Thus, only when $m$ satisfies the above congruence are the candidate pairs eliminated. The remaining $\frac{p_{k+1}-2}{p_{k+1}}$ proportion of candidates are retained, corresponding to $p_{k+1}-2$ incremental pairs within the cycle $\prod_{j=1}^{k+1} p_j$.  

## 4. Proof by Contradiction for the Infinitude of Twin Primes  

Assume there exists a largest twin prime pair $(P, P+2)$. Then, for all $n > P$, there must **not** exist any candidate pairs $(q, q+2)$ in the pseudo-twin prime set $\mathcal{S}(2,3,\ldots,p_k)$ that are **not covered by actual primes**. By Theorem 3.1, property transitivity ensures that such candidate pairs persist with a **non-zero proportion** at any sieving stage and **retain a quantity no fewer than $p_k - 2$** within subsequent cycles $\prod_{j=1}^{k} p_j$, thereby contradicting the assumption of "no larger twin primes.

**Conclusion 4.1**: Within the cyclic period $\prod_{j=1}^{k} p_j$, the incremental retention of candidate pairs is always greater than zero, implying the infinitude of twin primes.  

## 5. Discussion and Future Work  

1. **Limitations**: This paper does not rigorously quantify the cumulative effects of property transitivity and focuses solely on the incremental retention of pseudo-twin prime pairs within periodic cycles (i.e., the retention increments introduced by each successive prime in the sieve process). Future work should integrate analytic number theory tools (e.g., the Bombieri-Vinogradov theorem) to further analyze sieve densities.
2. **Extensions**: Investigate the infinitude of prime pairs with generalized gaps (e.g., 6, 12) or probabilistic thresholds of property transitivity via random models.  

## 6. Conclusion  

By constructing a periodic property model of prime sieves, this paper demonstrates the persistent existence of pseudo-twin primes and infers the infinitude of twin primes via contradiction. While a rigorous proof requires quantitative sieve density analysis, the transitivity of properties offers a novel perspective on the Twin Prime Conjecture.
